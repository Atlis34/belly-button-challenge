# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 challenge assignment

All code was written and tested by myself, Ryan MacFarlane.  No tutor was used, but I did receive help and guidance from the Xpert Learning AI Assistant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All code was written in Visual Studio Code - and was tested using Google Chrome.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also placed the app.js file in two different spots, just to be safe.  One is in the main belly-button-challenge folder (just because I had heard it was a best practice to have the app.js and index.html files in the same folder, but there is also a copy within the 'static' folder, which is the main file I worked on and tested.  Just want to point that out.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application was also deployed to GitHub pages, as requested by the exercise.
